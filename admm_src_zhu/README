This code belongs directly to the paper "Zhu, Y. (2017). An Augmented ADMM Algorithm With Application to the Generalized Lasso Problem. Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics, 26(1), 195â€“204. https://doi.org/10.1080/10618600.2015.1114491"
I have used their code to solve the Generalized Lasso problem using the Augmented ADMM algorithm, described in their paper.

Original README:
First, type ``make clean" and ``make" to clean and compile the C code. 
Then, go to scripts/ folder and execute the three .sh files to reproduce the three Figures in the paper.
